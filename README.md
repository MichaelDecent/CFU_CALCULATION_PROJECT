# CFU_CALCULATOR_PROJECT

## Colony-Forming Unit (CFU or cfu) 
This is a measure of viable bacterial or fungal cells. In direct microscopic counts (cell counting using haemocytometer) where all cells, dead and living, are counted,but CFU measures only viable cells. For convenience the results are given as CFU/mL (colony-forming units per milliliter) for liquids, and CFU/g (colony-forming units per gram) for solids. CFU can be calculated using miles and misra method, it is useful to determine the microbiological load and magnitude of infection in blood and other samples.

  ### Fomular for calculating The CFU/ml: ###
  `cfu/ml = (colony count x dilution factor) / volume of culture plate`
